<h2 align="center">How it works</h2>
<br/>

<h3 align="center">Step 1: Clone the repo</h3>
<p align="center">This repository contains a lot of starters. Enter <code>agency</code>, but make sure to check other starters too, later.</p>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcms/starters.git
```

<br/>
<h3 align="center">Step 2: Start BCMS (Backend)</h3>
<p align="center">This step will make sure that you are running BCMS locally and in the background, which is required before starting the Gatsby.js development server.</p>

```bash
cd starters/cms/agency
```

<p>Run <code>docker-compose build</code> command, followed with <code>docker-compose up</code>.</p>
<p>Your BCMS instance is now up and running, and can be inspected by visiting <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<br/>
<h3 align="center">Step 3: Start Gatsby.js (Frontend)</h3>
<p align="center">After this step you will be able to edit the Frontend side of your starter, everything from styles, content, pages structure and much more.</p>

```bash
cd starters/gatsby/agency
```

<p>Before anything, make sure to install node packages ( <code>npm install</code> ).</p>
<p>Run <code>npm run dev</code> command to start the local frontend development server. This will pull the data from the BCMS which is running in the background.</p>
<p>Your Gatsby app is now up and running and can be inspected by visiting <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>
