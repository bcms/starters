# BCMS Simple Blog code starter for Nuxt.js

This is a bare-bones Nuxt.js starter kit for BCMS, a headless CMS. It's minimal but solid, with a clean codebase that hooks directly into your BCMS project, ready to extend and scale as needed.

## Getting Started

Run the following command

```bash
npx @thebcms/cli create nuxt starter simple-blog
```

and follow the prompts.
